					About Me
				</h1>
				<p>
					Hello! My name's Walter, I'm a senior at Iowa State University. I was born and raised in 
					Minneapolis, Minnesota. 
				</br></br>
					My part in this project was sensing signs of distress. I did this by developing an algorithm to use
					a phone's accelerometer to detect if the phone is falling, as well as using a seperate library to
					read audio inputs to see if the user said phrases like "Help me".
				</br></br>

						project page
