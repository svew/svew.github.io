					Cybot Navigational Robot
				</h1>
				<p>
					In my CPRE 288: Embedded Systems course, we spent the semester programming modified Roomba robots to 
					navigate an	obstacle course of PVC pipes. Our roomba was modified, with an attached microcontroller
					we could program to intruct the roomba, read and write UART and wifi signals, and read sensor data.
					By reading sensor data and telling the roomba where to move, students could either remotely control
					the roomba through an unknown randomized course or attempt to program it to autonomously travel
					through the course.
				</br></br>
					One of my great accomplishments during this course was the development of a visual display of what
					the robot's sensors were reading that allowed me to traverse the obstacle course in half the time
					as the next fastest robot. The roomba would send data to a Java swing application, which would then
					plot where it believed pillars or obstacles existed in the obstacle course. It would also show the
					elements in the obstacle course moving as the robot did, which gave us an advantage in not having to
					rescan the area every time the robot moves.
