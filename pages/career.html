							Led supplimentary recitation sections covering topics like interfaces, abstract classes, 
							polymorphism, generics, type erasure, exception handling, advanced JUnit testing, big-O 
							runtimes, search algorithms, sorting algorithms, linked lists, binary trees, heaps, graphs, 
							stacks, and	queues
						</li><li>
							Substituted for professor during lecture when he was unavailable

						Garmin International
					</h1><h3>
						Software Intern, May 2018 - July 2018
					</h3><p>
						During the summer of 2018, I worked in Kansas City, Kansas with Garmin's avionics division. My 
						accomplishments included:
						<ul><li>
							Improving my team's workflow by writing Python scripts to compare in-house aviation take-off 
							and landing calculations against airplane manufacturer calculations
						</li><li>
							Developing other scripts to automate sequence of git actions, VS builds, and simulator 
							setups which are common to the team's development process
						</li><li>
							Presenting technical information on work achieved to team, and helping them integrate the
							new scripts with their workflow
						</li></ul>
						My main takeaway from my time spent at Garmin International were the skills of requirement
						gathering and customer communication. In my case, my customers were my fellow co-workers, and I
						spent a lot of time trying to envision a tool to improve their productivity which would cover
						as many use cases as possible without being overly complex. I also learned quite a bit of Python
						along the way.

					<h1>Clearwater Analytics</h1>
					<h3>Development Intern, May 2017 - July 2017</h3>
					<p>
						In the summer of 2017, I worked in Boise, Idaho with Clearwater Anayltics. Over the course of
						the summer, I worked with a small team to focus on reducing calculation times of their market
						analytics by switching their code from Java to C++. My accomplishments included:
						<ul><li>
							Reducing calculation times by an average of 85%
						</li><li>
							Designing an architecture of support libraries for future job process development and
							job-server commmunication
						</li><li>
							Conducting research into viable C++ libraries for future company-wide use, since this was
							the first time the company had worked with the language
						</li><li>
							Maintaining a steady development cycle in our small Agile team using sprint planning
							techniques
						</li></ul>
						My main takeaway from my time spend at Clearwater Analytics was learning how to create a useful
						program architecture that could be used by future co-workers, team communication, and general
						C++ knowledge. Creating code which prevents people from wanting to throw it away on sight means
						making sure everything is consistently formatted and documented, and that the interfaces through
						which others will interact with the library are sensible. We also maintained good communication
						by using tools like Jira to keep track of our tasks, and having regular formal and informal 
						meetings to talk about progress and decision-making. Finally, I got a real taste for C++ when I
						had to give myself a crash course and learn the language in 2 weeks before I could be useful to
						my team.
