					Watch Dog
				</h1>
				<p>
					Watch Dog is a safety app created during HACKISU along with 3 other members. It's designed to detect 
					if its user is in distress or under attack. The	inspiration behind this app was a recent fatal 
					attack on a fellow ISU student while they were alone. Our goal was to create an app which could 
					sense signs of distress, and alert emergency contacts, record video/audio evidence, or sound an 
					alarm to scare off an attacker.
				</br></br>
					My part in this project was sensing signs of distress. I did this by developing an algorithm to use
					a phone's accelerometer to detect if the phone is falling, as well as using a seperate library to
					read audio inputs to see if the user said phrases like "Help me".
